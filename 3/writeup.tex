\section{System design}
I laid the program out into three main parts: parser, sorters, and suppressor.
I originally planned on forking all three from one function (and then passing the
run function to utilize through a function prototype) but this proved to be
infeasible so I went with specialized forking functions.

\section{Timing}
Ran on Les Miserable, number of copies of text shown.

\section{Challenges}
Biggest challenge was definitely getting the pipes to behave correctly. I also
struggled with debugging (using gdb) on multiple processes. Even using the
"set follow-fork-mode parent/child" command was still a pain to do.

\section{Questions}
\subsection{Main point of the assignment}
Multiple processes (fork()) and pipes specifically. Probably also some general
system knowledge, fd manipulation, etc.

\subsection{Solution testing}
gdb, valgrind. Mostly testing on files from Project Gutenburg with different numbers
of processes and checking output. Checked on small input files at first to get an
expected output.

\subsection{I learned...}
How to handle pipes correctly and deal with the issues caused by forking off multiple
child processes within a single application.
