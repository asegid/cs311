<h1>Project 2: UNIX File I/O</h1>

<h2>Due: Monday, 4 February 2013, 23:59:59</h2>


<p>In this assignment, you will be working with UNIX file I/O system calls.</p>

<p>Write a C program on <tt>os-class</tt> called <tt>myar.c</tt>. This program will illustrate the use
of file I/O on UNIX by maintaining a UNIX archive library, in the standard archive format.</p>


<p>Once compiled your program should run in a manner similar to the standard UNIX command <tt>ar</tt>.
You may wish to look at the man page for <tt>ar</tt> for insight, however, for this assignment, the
following is the syntax your program must support:</p>

<p><tt>myar key afile name ...</tt></p>

<p>where <tt>afile</tt> is the name of the archive file to be used, and key is one of the following
options:</p>


<p>
</p><table cellpadding="3">
  <tbody><tr>
    <td align="LEFT">
      <tt>-q</tt>
    </td>
    <td align="LEFT">
      quickly append named files to archive
    </td>
    <td align="LEFT">
      &nbsp;
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="LEFT">
      <tt>-x</tt>
    </td>
    <td align="LEFT">
      extract named files
    </td>
    <td align="LEFT">
      &nbsp;
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="LEFT">
      <tt>-t</tt>
    </td>
    <td align="LEFT">
      print a concise table of contents of the archive
    </td>
    <td align="LEFT">
      &nbsp;
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr><td align="LEFT"><tt>-v</tt></td>
    <td align="LEFT">print a verbose table of contents of the archive</td>
    <td align="LEFT">&nbsp;</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="LEFT"><tt>-d</tt></td>
    <td align="LEFT">delete named files from archive</td>
    <td align="LEFT">&nbsp;</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="LEFT">
      <tt>-A</tt>
    </td>
    <td align="LEFT">
      quickly append all ``regular'' files in the current directory
    </td>
    <td align="LEFT">
      (except the archive itself)
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="LEFT">
      <tt>-w</tt>
    </td>
    <td align="LEFT">
      Extra credit: for a given timeout, add all modified files to the archive.
    </td>
    <td align="LEFT">
      (except the archive itself)
    </td>
  </tr>

</tbody></table>

<br>
<p>The archive file maintained must use exactly the standard format defined in
<tt>/usr/inc1ude/ar.h</tt>, and in fact may be tested with archives created with the
<tt>ar</tt> command. The options listed above are compatible with the options having the
same name in the <tt>ar</tt> command, except for the following exceptions: the
<tt>-v</tt> and <tt>-t</tt> command take no further argument, and list all files in the
archive. <tt>-v</tt> is short for <tt> -t -v</tt> on the <tt>ar</tt> command. The
<tt>-A</tt> command in a new option not in the usual <tt>ar</tt> command.</p>

<p>Notes:</p> 

<ol>
  <li>
    For the <tt>-q</tt> command <tt>myar</tt> should create an archive file if it doesn't exist,
    using permissions ``666''. For the other commands <tt>myar</tt> reports an error if the archive
    does not exist, or is in the wrong format.
  </li>
  <li>
    You will have to use the system calls <tt>stat</tt> and <tt>utime</tt> to properly deal with
    extracting and restoring the proper timestamps. Since the archive format only allows one
    timestamp, store the <tt>mtime</tt> and use it to restore both the <tt>atime</tt> and
    <tt>mtime</tt>. Permissions should also be restored to the original value, subject to
    <tt>umask</tt> limitation.
  </li>
  <li>
    The <tt>-q</tt> and <tt>-A</tt> commands do not check to see if a file by the chosen name
    already exists. It simply appends the files to the end of the archive.
  </li>
  <li>
    The <tt>-x</tt> and <tt>-d</tt> commands operate on the first file matched in the archive,
    without checking for further matches.
  </li>
  <li>
    In the case of the <tt>-d</tt> option, you will have to build a new archive file to recover
    the space. Do this by unlinking the original file after it is opened, and creating a new archive
    with the original name.
  </li>
  <li>
    You are required to handle multiple file names as arguments.
  </li>
  <li>
    Since file I/O is expensive, do not make more than one pass through the archive file, an
    issue especially relevant to the multiple delete case.
  </li>
  <li>
    For the <tt>-w</tt> flag, the command will take as long as specified by the timeout argument. You should print out a status message upon adding a new file. This may result in many different copies of the same file in the archive.
  </li>
  <li>
    For extra credit, any time a file is added that already exists, remove the old copy from the archive, but ONLY if it is not the same. If identical, do not add the new file.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
Your write-up should include (at minimum) the following:

</p><ol>
  <li> a design for your system, as well as places your implementation deviated from this
    design</li>
  <li>a work log, detailing what you did when -- this can fairly easily be created if you
    are using some form of revision control</li>
  <li>any challenges you overcame in completing this assignment</li>
  <li>answers to the following questions:</li>
  <ol>
    <li> what do you think the main point of this assignment is?</li>
    <li> how did you ensure your solution was correct? Testing details, for instance.</li>
    <li> what did you learn?</li>
  </ol>
</ol>

<p>Things to turn in:</p>
<ol>
<li> source code </li>
<li> write-up, as a tex document </li>
<li> any support files necessary to compile your tex document </li>
<li> a makefile to build both source code and your tex file </li>
</ol>

<p>You are not allowed to use Lyx to create the document. You must create the document "by
hand", instead. I will provide a makefile and a LaTeX template file for your use -- see
the course website. You must modify the makefile to handle your source code, as well.</p>
